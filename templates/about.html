<!-- Introduction: Black-Scholes model -->
<h3>The Generalized Black-Scholes Pricing Formulae</h3>
<p>
  The Black-Scholes formula might be the most used probability model/tool in
  everyday use - even if we consider all other scientific disciplines. Tens and
  thousands people, including traders, market makers, and salespeople, use
  option formulas several times a day.
</p>
<!-- Black-Scholes formulae for call and put option -->
<p>
  The Black-Scholes model can be generalized by incorporating a carry rate \( b \).
  This model can be used to price European options on stocks, stocks paying a
  continuous dividend yield, options on futures, and currency options:
  $$ call = S e^{(b-r)T} N(d_1) - X e^{-rT} N(d_2) $$
  $$ put = X e^{-rT} N(-d_2) - S e^{(b-r)T} N(-d_1), $$
  where
  $$ d_1 = \frac{ln(S/X) + \left(b + \frac{\sigma^2}{2}\right)T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}} $$
  $$ d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T}$$
  \( b = r \) gives the Black and Scholes (1973) stock option model.
  <br/>
  \( b = r - q \) gives the Merton (1973) stock option model with continuous
  dividend yield \( q \).
  <br/>
  \( b = 0 \) gives the Black (1976) futures option model.
  <br/>
  \( b = r - r_f \) gives the Garman and Kohlhagen (1983) currency option model.

<!-- Introduction: Greeks -->
<h3>The Black-Scholes Greeks</h3>
<p>
  The option sensitivities or Greeks are the partial derivatives of the
  Black-Scholes formulae. The partial derivative is a measure of the sensitivity
  of the option price to a small change in a parameter of the formula.
</p>
<!-- Black-Scholes formulae for the greeks -->
<h3>Delta</h3>
<p>
  Delta is the option's sensitivity to small changes in the underlying asset
  price. For a call:
    $$ \Delta_{call} = \frac{\partial call}{\partial S} = e^{(b-r)T} N(d_1) > 0 $$
  While for a put:
    $$ \Delta_{put} = \frac{\partial put}{\partial S} = e^{(b-r)T}
    \left( N(d_1) - 1 \right) > 0 $$
</p>
<h3>Gamma</h3>
<p>
  Gamma is the delta's sensitivity to small changes in the underlying asset
  price. Gamma is identical for a call and put option:
  $$ \Gamma_{call,put} = \frac{\partial^2 call}{\partial S^2}
  = \frac{\partial^2 put}{\partial S^2}
  = \frac{n(d_1) e^{(b-r)T}}{S \sigma \sqrt{T}} > 0 $$
</p>
<h3>Vega</h3>
<p>
  Vega is the option's sensitivity to a small change in the volatility of the
  underlying asset. Vega is identical for a call and put option:
  $$ \nu_{call,put} = \frac{\partial call}{\partial \sigma}
  = \frac{\partial put}{\partial \sigma} = S e^{(b-r)T} n(d_1) \sqrt{T} > 0 $$
</p>
<h3>Theta</h3>
<p>
  Theta is the option's sensitivity to a small change in time to maturity. As
  time to maturity decreases, it is common to express theta as minus the partial
  derivative with respect to time. For a call:
  $$ \Theta_{call} = - \frac{\partial call}{\partial T} = - \frac
  {S e^{(b-r)T} n(d_1) \sigma}{2 \sqrt{T}}
  - (b-r) S e^{(b-r)T} N(d_1) - r X e^{-rT} N(d_2) \leq \geq 0 $$
  While for a put:
  $$ \Theta_{put} = - \frac{\partial put}{\partial T} = - \frac
  {S e^{(b-r)T} n(d_1) \sigma}{2 \sqrt{T}}
  + (b-r) S e^{(b-r)T} N(-d_1) + r X e^{-rT} N(-d_2) \leq \geq 0 $$
</p>
<h3>Rho</h3>
<p>
  Rho is the option's sensitivity to small changes in the risk-free interest
  rate. For a call:
  $$ \rho_{call} = \frac{\partial call}{\partial r} = T X e^{-rT} N(d_2) > 0 $$
  While for a put:
  $$ \rho_{put} = \frac{\partial put}{\partial r} = - T X e^{-rT} N(-d_2) > 0 $$
